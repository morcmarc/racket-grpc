# racket-grpc ![https://travis-ci.org/morcmarc/racket-grpc.svg?branch=master](https://travis-ci.org/morcmarc/racket-grpc.svg?branch=master)

A racket library for [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/). Work in progress.

## Requirements

The library is only compatible with gRPC Core 4.0.0.

### macOS

I found the easiest way to install gRPC is via homebrew:

```
$ brew install grpc
```

## Setup

```
$ make install
```

To run the tests:

```
$ make test
```
